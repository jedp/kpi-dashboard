KPI Dashboard
=============

Motivation
----------
[Mozilla Persona](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/) is "an identity system
for the web." More specifically, it is a distributed, privacy-preserving single
sign-on system for the web. Rather than having to manage multiple usernames and
passwords, it allows you to sign in to a website using the email address of your
choice.

As part of our goal to make Persona the best sign-in solution, we are 
continually working to streamline and improve the user experience. To better
understand how our users are using the system, we collect certain statistics
(suitably anonymized) about users' interaction with the interface.

The goal of the KPI dashboard is to present this information in a meaningful
and informative manner.
